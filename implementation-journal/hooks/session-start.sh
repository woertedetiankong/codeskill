# SessionStart hook for the implementation-journal skill.
#
# On startup/resume/clear: if the project has a restart entry
# (docs/tasks/NEXT-SESSION.md), inject it into context so the session
# resumes without the user pasting anything.
# On post-compaction starts (source == "compact"): additionally remind the
# session to refresh continuity docs, since compaction is the unplanned
# context loss the skill's "planned pause" workflow cannot catch.
#
# stdout of a SessionStart hook is added to Claude's context.
# Exits 0 silently when the project has no journal — safe to install globally.
# Not installed automatically; see hooks/README.md.
